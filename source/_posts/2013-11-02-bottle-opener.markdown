To kickoff my posts around design (good or bad), I thought I would start with a simple, yet amazing bottle opener by [Brendan Ravenhill](http://www.brendanravenhill.com/bottle-opener/).

As he describes it, "A simple tool of great utility. One magnet captures the bottle cap; one holds opener to the fridge."

See it in action:

Trust me, you want one of these especially at your next party. 

Or if you are feeling handy you can always make your own:
